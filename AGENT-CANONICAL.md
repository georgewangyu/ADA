# Canonical Agent Rules

Shared baseline rules for repositories that point to this file from
their local `AGENTS.md`.

## Execution Defaults

1. Understand scope before editing.
2. Prefer small, reversible changes.
3. Validate outcomes with relevant checks.
4. Update docs when behavior or structure changes.
5. Do not claim completion unless verified.

## Context Strategy

1. Keep startup docs concise.
2. Load nearest task-relevant docs on demand.
3. Prefer a token budget over fixed file-size thresholds.

## Communication Style

1. Be direct and brief by default.
2. Surface tradeoffs for non-obvious decisions.
3. State assumptions explicitly.

## Safety

1. Ask before destructive or external actions.
2. Keep secrets out of committed files.
3. Prefer reversible operations when possible.
