# ADA AGENTS Bootstrap

At session start in this repository, read in order:

1. `AGENT-CANONICAL.md`
2. `AGENT.md`
3. `README.md`
4. `SOUL.md`

Then read nearest task-relevant docs.

## Scope

This repo contains reusable agent infrastructure and templates.

- Prefer generic, portable guidance.
- Avoid project-specific or private personal workflow details.

## Priority

- User instructions override file instructions.
- More specific, task-local docs override broad guidance.
- Local repo docs may override canonical docs when needed.
